## Welcome to Harmony!  

*Public Beta* :tada:

Harmony is Bit's next generation. It is a highly extensible and flexible infrastructure for developing modern applications in a modular way. Whether you are building a new modern application, or seek to get more from the components in your existing projects, Harmony will take your development with components to the next level.  

Harmony is already being adopted as a standard component infrastructure by the world's best software teams. Now, it is in public beta so please feel free to try it out, start tapping into the true power of your components, and don't forget to [share yourfedback](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues)!  

### Get started

There are a few ways for you to get started with Harmony.  

#### [Take the Tutorial :feet:](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/tutorial/install-bit)

- Take a hands-on approach with this step-by-step tutorial for building a modular React application with Bit components created in the workspace and imported from external projects. Learn how to install and set up a Bit workspace, add components, add life-full documentation and compositions, define isolated build and test environments, define and explore component dependencies in the workspace, version components and auto-update dependencies, import and export components to remote scopes to be shared across many projects, and more.  

#### [Explore the demo project :crystal_ball:](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/introduction/try-bit)

- Get a fully functional Bit workspace with independent components developed and managed by Bit, in this project and imported from other projects, where you can explore and experiment with every part of the Bit workspace, development UI, change and manage components, and learn how it works.  

#### Watch Video Guides :tv:  (**Coming soon!**)

- Start with step-by-step video guides to walk you through every step from creating a component to building a full-blown micro-applications architecture that scales and accelerates development, delivery, and innovation. Coming soon!
