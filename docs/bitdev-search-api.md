- [Search Context](#search-context)
- [Search components](#search-components)

The Search API helps you find the components you want. For example, you can find all components that performe a specific functionality. It is designed to help you find the results you are looking for. The results are sorted by their functionality and quality.  
The search is a global search. You can set the search context to fit to where you want to get results from. Use [filters](#using-filters) to better fit the search.

## Search Context

The Search API supports finding public, open source components.

> **Note** - `network`: `public`.
