## Component ID

Each component has a unique ID. This ID consists of `scope`, as defined in its configuration and `component-name` combined. This means that when `@acme.base-ui` is set as the scope of your workspace and you've created the component `account/login-form`, the component ID is `@acme.base-ui/account/login-form`.
