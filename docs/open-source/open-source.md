## We Build Bit with Bit

At Bit, we build everything with Bit: Starting from open-source projects like Bit itself to the Bit.dev cloud platform and even Ripple CI.  

Every feature or service we build is a **scope of components**. Each scope of components contains everything the team needs to deliver this feature: UI components, data-connected components, React hooks, Node modules, and even serverless functions. Our teams expose and share their components to each other and continuously integrate to build products.  

We aim to open-source as much code as possible. Thanks to Bit, it becomes easier than ever to open-source specific components or even entire features, even if they live inside a private application. As of today we have **over 40 open-source scopes with over 500 open-source components** available to the community on Bit.dev.

- [Evangelist](https://bit.dev/teambit/evangelist) - Our marketing team scope which is responsible for our marketing site and all marketing related pages and components on Bit.dev. It empowers the marketing team to ship new updates to production autonomously as well as provide services to other teams who can use these components to create better and faster marketing for their products. The marketing team gets to ensure a single and consistent tone and visual language across all experiences and products.  

- [Documenter](https://bit.dev/teambit/documenter)- Our component documentation teamâ€™s scope is responsible for the component documentation product on Bit.dev. This scope contains all documentation related components on Bit.dev. It empowers them to ship updates and component documentation services to the rest of our team internally and to the community.  

- [MDX Integration Scope](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx) - A standalone service extending Bit to support the MDX file format from all ends (UI, modules, extensions, etc.) and acts as a service for other teams to consume and build new services and features on top. Thanks to this Scope you can use MDX to create awesome documentation for your components in Bit.
