Bit makes life easier for JavaScript developers who build their applications with components. If youâ€™re looking to publish individual components from a repository to curated collections, you came to the right place! Bit is a tools to help you distribute and maintain your design system components, helpers, pages and features. It gives you:

**Workspace UI**: All your components managed in a single place. See test results, rendered stories, dependency graph insights and documentation in the a dedicated development environment, for each component.

**Component isolation**: Bit helps you keep your components isolated from each other. Less spaghetti code and relative requires. Bit creates a module from each component with its own absolute name, dependency graph and configuration. Isolated components are easier to reuse by other developers, projects and components.

**Connected components workspace**: Inside a Bit workspace, all your components are automatically linked to each other. When you make a change, you can see the downstream effects right in your development environment.

**Automated documentation**:

**Fast incremental builds**:

**Bulk publishing**: When it's time to do a release, Bit detects which components have changed and their dependents, bumps their appropriate version numbers, and publishes each components as an individual module.

**Changelog tracking**: Whenever a PR is created, you can require developers to provide a major/minor/patch log entry for the affected componnets. During publishing, these changes will be automatically aggregated into a nicely formatted changelog.
