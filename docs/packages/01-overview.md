Bit components can be thought of as a super-set of standard packaged node modules. Each component contains a consumable package in addition to its documentation, history, Bit configurations and more. Components are not only consumed as standard packages but can also be published to NPM or any other package registry (in addition to being 'exported' to a bit server)

Each component package configurations is determined by its environment and by the `workspace.jsonc` configuration file.
