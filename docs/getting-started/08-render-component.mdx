Bit uses `compositions` to simulate a component in any potential use case. Each composition is a mini-application you can use to render different instances or usages of a component. 

## Create a Composition

Start by creating a new `compositions` file:

```shell
$ touch components/react/ui/button/button.composition.tsx
```

Composition file names must fit these patterns `*.composition.` or `*.compositions.`, then end with of `js/jsx/ts/tsx` extensions.

Then, paste this implementation:

```tsx title="components/ui/button/button.composition.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "./button";

export const PrimaryButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>
      Primary Button
    </Button>
  );
};

export const SecondaryButton = () => {
  return <Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>;
};

export const DisabledButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button disabled variant="primary">
      Disabled Button
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## Browse Compositions

Head over to the 'compositions' tab to see the various `Button` compositions being rendered. Each exported function is rendered as a separate application.
