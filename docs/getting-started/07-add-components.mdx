title: Add Components

A Bit component has all the information it needs for it to be **independently** shareable, consumable and maintainable.
That includes its distributable code, development files, history, documentation and various Bit configurations.
Most of that information is generated automatically by Bit.

This section will start our components' journey to independency by tracking them using Bit.

> The word “component” is ascribable to any independent feature, whether it is a simple UI primitive, a piece of logic, a data-connected component, or even a full page.

## Add components

Our workspace has 4 components:

- 1 React hook
- 2 UI elements
- 1 Widget

Track the React hook with the namespace 'hooks':

```shell
$ bbit add components/hooks/use-jokes/ -n hooks
```

Track the UI elements with the namespace 'ui/elements'. Use the `*` wildcard to select all folders under 'ui-elements'

```shell
bbit add components/ui-elements/* -n ui/elements
```

### Resolve an issue found in a component

Go back to the Workspace UI (https://localhost:3000) to see the newly tracked components.

Our 'button' component is marked with a `1, N` to its right to signify that it is a new component that has 1 issue that needs to be resolved.

To understand what this issue is, let's check our workspace status:

```shell
$ bbit status
```

```shell {7,8}
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > hooks/use-jokes ... ok
     > ui-elements/app-bar ... ok
     > ui-elements/button ...  issues found
       missing packages dependencies (make sure you've added it to the package dependencies, and use `bit install` to make sure all package dependencies are installed):
          button.spec.tsx -> @testing-library/react
```

The above output informs us that `@testing-library/react`, required by our component's test file, is missing.

### Install dependencies

We'll install `@testing-library/react` using [Dependency Resolver](/docs/dependencies/overview), a Bit extension that handles dependencies in a workspace.

```shell
$ bbit install @testing-library/react
```

The new package is now added as to our workspace dependency configuration:

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "@testing-library/react": "11.2.5"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {}
    },
    "packageManagerArgs": [],
    "devFilePatterns": [
      "**/*.spec.ts"
    ],
    "strictPeerDependencies": true
  }
```

:::note
Our package is listed under `dependencies` even though it is a dev dependency. Dependency Resolver searches for the files requiring each package.
If all files are dev files (test files, etc.) then a depedency will be considered as a dev dependency even though it is not listed as such. Learn more about it [here](/docs/dependencies/dependency-policies).

### Add a component that is dependant on other components

Our project has one component left to be tracked: 'tech-jokes-viewer'.

Our 'tech-jokes-viewer' is dependent on 2 other components: 'button' and 'use-jokes'. Each of these tracked components was symlinked by Bit to the workspace `node_modules` directory.
This enables components to use other components using an absolute path that will not "tie them up" to a specific context.

Before we track 'tech-jokes-viewer', let's change its import paths from `org-demo` to your own username or organization name (since that will be the prefix for the generated component packages required by this component)

```tsx
// REPLACE 'demo-org' WITH YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION/USERNAME
import { Button } from '@demo-org/tech-jokes.ui.button';
import { useJokes } from '@demo-org/tech-jokes.hooks.use-jokes';
```
