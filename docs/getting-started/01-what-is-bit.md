title: What is Bit?
---

### Bit is the component platform for the modern web.  

Bit helps you build **modular applications** in a **fast, scalable, and consistent** way. It is a **standard infrastructure for components**, that helps you scale the development process to many teams building consistent and performant applications together. 

Bit’s workspace helps developers build in a modular way, so each component is independently developed, tested, built, versioned, and published. All components and dependencies are managed in a simple harmonic “monolith-like” experience.  

Bit’s cloud platform helps teams collaborate on components and build together. Organizations can distribute web development into autonomous teams that build apps/features in decoupled codebases. All teams can easily share components, collaborate, and integrate with each other. Each team can develop and release components autonomously, while the organization gets tools to standardize and collaborate on components across teams and projects.  

**Bit is used by thousands of teams**, including some of the world’s best tech organizations whose products you use every day. Join us to build better web applications faster together too.

> **Tip 1**: Bit components can be anything from UI components to Hooks, Widgets, Pages, Features or even Node Modules. You decide what should be componentized first.

> **Tip 2**: Bit is 100% modular and extensible. In fact, Bit is built 100% out of Bit components. This means you can extend, change, replace or customize it to do anything you like. No limits.


## Popular Use Cases

Developer teams will enjoy a shared infrastructure that lets them scale web development together. It increases the speed of delivery, allows teams to easily integrate and collaborate with each other, while keeping them autonomous to constantly build and deliver new features.  

#### UI Design System  

##### Read -> “[How We Build Our Design System](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-we-build-our-design-system-15713a1f1833)”  

![Design system](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/bit-design-system.jpeg)  


*Design systems* are how great teams keep their UI consistent across multiple pages and applications. Modern design systems are built with components, which are used as shared building blocks to ensure consistency. Bit is a perfect way to construct a design system from independent components which are developed, built, and published by custom regulated standards. Bit.dev is the most effective platform for teams to distribute, discover, use, and collaborate on their component-driven design system. Instead of a cumbersome monolithic and often irrelevant library, Bit provides a collaborative and scalable ecosystem where everyone can share and discover components, get and suggest changes, ensure consistency, and build together. For example, whenever there’s a new version of a component, a single push of a button can send the update as an automated PR to every impacted repository in the organization. And, a developer that uses one of your components in their own application, can suggest changes back to you without having to dive into your repository or making a complex PR to your project. Super cool, right? And, it’s also a great way for developers to include more people, like designers, in their web development process - directly over code, and in a visual way. 

#### Micro Frontends  

##### Read -> “[How We Build Micro Frontends](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-we-build-micro-front-ends-d3eeeac0acfc)”  


![Micro Frontends](https://i.ibb.co/fn8krfn/homepage-components-micro-frontends.png)

*Micro frontends* are a philosophy of how software should be built, and how teams and organizations should work together. Bit is the most production-ready and scalable way to build Micro Frontends, driven by modern components. Each team can autonomously build features in their own codebase, compose their components into any application, constantly release incremental upgrades through their own independent build pipeline, and at the same time easily expose 100% of their components for everyone else in the organization to discover and integrate into new projects. Need an example? Take a look at how the [homepage of Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is composed of components built in different repos, by different teams who own different scopes, and all integrated together to create every page on the website. To learn more how we build component-driven Micro Frontends read this post: “[How We Build Micro Frontends](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-we-build-micro-front-ends-d3eeeac0acfc)”.

#### Developer Designer Collaboration

Bit is a very effective way to bridge the gap between design and development. Unlike legacy tools, it helps developers include designers (and other people) in the development process.  

![Developer Designer Collaboration](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Overview-bitdev.png)

Bit makes it easy for developers to include designers, product managers, and business stakeholders in the development process of web applications. Everyone can easily discover, see, and collaborate on components in a visual way, together, and directly over code.

Bit makes it easy to document components in a visual way, while rendering the isolated visual of every component’s version with different examples and compositions. 

When a developer implements a component, the designer can instantly see how it looks in the code and what will the user get in production. When there’s a change to a component, the designer can easily monitor and ensure that all visual changes are according to design guidelines. And, designers can play with all components hands-on, try different things, save examples for developers to implement, and become active partners in the development process. 

Bit also plays beautifully with tools like Zeplin and components designed in tools like Figma or Sketch. Together, it brings designers and developers closer than ever before possible.


#### Sharing Code Between Teams

Bit is a very effective way to share code between teams.  

With Bit, each team can easily create and publish components from their own independent codebase. Via the component cloud, all teams can share and discover each other’s components, and quickly integrate them into different projects. Advanced features make this process more collaborative, so it becomes very easy to suggest feedback and changes to shared code, build together, and stay in sync.

The ease of publishing alongside the ease of discovery and reuse make Bit a highly scalable solution for sharing code between teams. Bit can be used to share UI components, but also any other form of reusable code units like Hooks or even Node modules, util functions, serverless functions and more. 


#### Standardization and Consistency  

*Web development standardization and consistency* means that all components will follow the same design patterns, will be developed using the same development environments, tested and built using the same pipelines, and will be documented and published using the same templates. This way an organization can ensure consistency in the development process, and deliver higher quality applications which are more resilient and performant. Bit is the most powerful yet flexible way to achieve standardization for components. It provides features such as customizable and reusable development environments, which ensure all teams create components the same way, yet living room for unavoidable changes when necessary. Customizable and reusable build pipelines ensure all components are built and tested the same way by predefined standards. Fully customizable docs templates ensure all components can easily be published and used by other developers and teams.  And, since Bit is 100% extensible, this is just where your imagination starts.


#### Autonomous Teams and Independent Delivery

Independent components and decoupled codebases means independent teams and autonomous team delivery.

Conway’s law suggests a clear symmetry between a codebase architectural style and the way that codebase is built by people working together. Building applications with independent components means developers create and deliver features independently. It means they are completely decoupled from anything that has the potential to become a blocker to their own progress. That naturally translates to faster delivery but that also reduces frustration, as each developer enjoys complete autonomy and full mastery over their own scope.

![Autonomous-Teams](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-10%20at%205.22.04%20PM.png)  


#### Scaling Web Development

As developers we are tasked with building innovative solutions for our products. When we don't have an efficient way of isolating and sharing code we've already implemented we are locked in an endless cycle of re-implementing the same functionality we built before and then maintaining it in multiple code bases. With the introduction of component-based frameworks like React, Angular and Vue our code has become more modular and the components we design can work in multiple apps and use cases. However they are implemented in rigid code repositories that don't allow us to easily reuse an already implemented piece of code.

Bit solves the problem of sharing and managing components between different projects so you can focus on building new, exciting and innovative solutions for your product or products. When utilizing Bit you can quickly share each component as a separate module from your project. Other developers can then take your component and use it as part of their components, like they would any other npm/yarn package, to drastically speed up their delivery. Moreover, they can then share their components for you to use.

Bit connects frontend teams by using components as services in a similar way to how microservices architecture has done so for backend teams.


#### Component Reuse  

*Component reuse* is a great way to speed software delivery, reduce effort on redundant code and maintenance, eliminate bugs and mistakes, and make sure more resources are focused on innovation. Components are by design modular, and therefor can and should be reused. Bit turns 100% of your components reusable as a seamless part of your workflow! Every single component you create becomes a fully reusable asset that can be very easily published, documented, and reused in new projects. No repository splitting, no complex configs, no overhead. Thanks to Bit.dev, code reuse can be infinitely scaled while making sure everything is always easily discoverable, and can be found and used one click away. And, using advanced features like ‘bit import’, it becomes easier than ever to quickly evolve and adjust components right from any new context.

### Extensible Development Tools

A rich and fully extensible toolset for modular application development.

#### Component Workspace

Bit’s workspace turns your project into a smart “monorepo” where components are fully decoupled from each other during every step of their development, build, test, and publish process. Bit will ensure each component is completely independent, while helping you manage and synchronize all components in your project with an effortless and holistic developer experience. It is a bedrock for truly modular and harmonized development.

![bit-workspace](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/harmony-workspace-1.png)   


#### Component Development Server  

Bit comes with a powerful dev server for components, that lets you render, test and document each component on its own server. A single workspace can maintain several types of development environment (Angular, React, Vue, etc) for different types of components, without requiring that you manage multiple processes.  

![component-dev-server](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Workspace-Grid%20(1).png)  


#### Component Dev Environments

Bit lets you develop multiple components in the same workspace, while completely decoupling their development environments from each other. Each component is developed in decoupled environment, so it can be developed completely independently. These environments are fully reusable, customizable, and extensible, so you can easily choose and standardize the way components are developed in your own applications.

![component-dev-environments](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-10%20at%202.56.23%20PM.png)  


#### Component Docs Templates
 
Make documentation an integral part of how you build components, using customizable and reusable templates that turn your code into beautiful docs. And, render and add visual compositions of components to see and learn how it works in different contexts and with its different dependencies or dependants. All with live hot reloading. When done, place your docs on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) for everyone else to discover and enjoy!

![docs-and-compositions](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Compositions%20(1).png)  


#### Component Dependency Graphs  

Bit is smart, it tracks and “knows” about the relationships between all components in your workspace. When you make a change, Bit “knows” which other components are impacted by the change, and helps you safely propagate the change to all impacted components while making sure they will still pass their build and tests. You can easily view and manage each component’s dependency graph, or the entire graph of your project, right in your local development UI.

![component-dependencies](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Dependencies%20(1).png)  


#### Component Versions and History  

Each component is versioned individually and has its own changelog so you can keep track of changes easily and quickly. View each component’s history, travel between versions, to easily learn what changed, by who, and when.  

![component-history](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/History.png)  


#### Component Builds and Testing

Build and test each component in complete isolation using predefined and customizable test environments, which can also be added into your pipelines. See builds and tests running live on every change as you code, to create bulletproof independent components that run anywhere.  

![component-tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Tests.png)  


##### Component Build Pipelines  

Build helps you standardize the build pipeline of all your components. Define jobs in a pipeline according to your best standards and make sure that all components are released through the same steps. Bit will even help you automate these workflows so that all components will go through these pipeline every time their builds will run.

![component-builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/component-builds.png)  
 

##### Incrementally Propagating Builds

 When you make a change in your project, Bit “knows” exactly which components are impacted by that change. It uses this information to rebuild and retest only the components impacted by the change, and infinitely propagates this process to all impacted dependents. The result? X30 (!) faster build times and surgical ability to pin-poin the impact of changes on the graph. 

![component-builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-10%20at%205.03.29%20PM.png)  


#### Independent Component Publishing
 
Enjoy 100% reusability for all components as a seamless side effect of your development workflow. Publish independent components in your workspace as individual packages without having to split your project, define complex configurations, or do anything else but simply developing your components in Bit’s workspace.  

![component-builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/yarn%20and%20npm.png)  


#### Scopes 

A “Scope” is a lightweight component server that provides a rich API for accessing, persisting and versioning components. Scopes host and organize your components so that they can be easily managed, exposed, and integrated into new environments.
