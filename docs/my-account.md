## Organization Billing  

[Click here to see bit.dev plans](https://bit.dev/pricing).

### Charging

Charging occurs at the monthly anniversary of the subscription (e.g. at the 17th of every month).  

### Adding and Removing Members

Members added to the organization are granted access immediately to the organizations feature, according to the plan.  
Members removed from the organization revoke their access and support immediately when removed.  
Charging is according to the number of actual number of members on the day of subscription's charge.  

### Canceling a Paid Subscription

Cancelling a subscription takes effect at the end of the billing period. Cancelling a plan does not delete the private collections. However, they are no longer accessible. 
Reactivating a subscription will renew the monthly subscription fee. If the account had private Collections, you would regain access to them immediately.

### Charging Issues

If there is an issue charging your payment method, the account will retain a 60 days grace period, in which all account members will still have access to premium features and private code components.
If the issue was not resolved by the end of the grace period, all access to premium features and private Collections is removed from the organization account.
