# Try Bit

## Create a New Modular App with Bit
Use Bit to build a new app, one component at a time. 

Create, compile, test and version each component independently while still enjoying a monolith-like dev experience -  one place, one workspace, to build and manage all your independent components. 

Export your components to a cloud-based virtual monorepo to have them available to multiple projects. 


## Add Bit to an Existing App
Bit integrates easily into any existing project. Use it to modularize your app by source-controlling, building, testing and sharing each of its components independently. Make your app more maintainable and scalable and pave the way to faster delivery with cross-project reusable components.

## Create a New Design System with Bit


## Add Bit to an Existing Design System
Initialize a Bit workspace on an existing design system repository to make each of its components independently versioned and available to be independently installed.
