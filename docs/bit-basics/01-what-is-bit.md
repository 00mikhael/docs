title: What is Bit?
---

Bit makes life easier for JavaScript developers who build their applications with components. If youâ€™re looking to develop and publish individual components from a repository to curated collections, use them to compose more applications, with visibility to stake holders and design teams... then you've come to the right place!  

Bit helps you develop your applications faster, with greater modularity and consistentency. Use Bit to distribute and maintain your design system, UI widgets, pages and features.

- **Component centric workspace:** In a single workspace Bit manages all components as separate modules. Each component has its own history and configuration.
- **Individual component publishing:** Publish each component separately so your consumers can use the specific components they need instead of a large library of components.
- **Designer <-> Developer Collaboration** Common portal for developers and designers to collaborate together directly code-to-design 
- **Smart dependency graph:** Inside a Bit repository all components are connected using a single dependency graph. This means that whenever you modify a single component you can see the potential downstream effects without publishing or running any scripts.
- **Development server for your components:** Render, test or document each component on its own development server. A single workspace can maintain several types of development environment (Angular, React, Vue, etc) per type of component, without requiring you to manage multiple processes.
- **Fast and incremental builds:** Bit builds your project according to your dependency graph. So if you only work on a few components, only the relevant parts of the graph are built saving time and resources.
- **Standardize component development:** From scaffolding new components to setting lint, build and test configurations - use Bit to set base configurations for all your components.
- **Component changelog:** Each component is versioned individually and has its own changelog so you can keep track of changes easily and quickly.

## Scaling your development

As developers we are tasked with building innovative solutions for our products. When we don't have an efficient way of isolating and sharing code we've already implemented we are locked in an endless cycle of re-implementing the same functionality we built before and then maintaining it in multiple code bases. With the introduction of component-based frameworks like React, Angular and Vue our code has become more modular and the components we design can work in multiple apps and use cases. However they are implemented in rigid code repositories that don't allow us to easily reuse an already implemented piece of code.

Bit solves the problem of sharing and managing components between different projects so you can focus on building new, exciting and innovative solutions for your product or products. When utilizing Bit you can quickly share each component as a separate module from your project. Other developers can then take your component and use it as part of their components, like they would any other npm/yarn package, to drastically speed up their delivery. Moreover, they can then share their components for you to use.

Bit connects frontend teams by using components as services in a similar way to how microservices architecture has done so for backend teams.
