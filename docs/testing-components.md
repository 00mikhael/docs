Bit can run tests for components which have a test task defined.

## Basics of testing Components

A component can contain test files. Bit executes them using test runners. Bit tests components using specialised components called Testers. A Tester is a component that takes another component's test files and executes them using test runners.

### Where are the tests being executed?

Bit tests components in an [isolated component environment](/docs/how-bit-works#component-isolation). Bit does this to ensure true isolation of components. So if a test process runs successfully, Bit can reproduce it anywhere.

## Defining a Tester

Every component can have a tester. Bit uses a global tester configuration for a workspace. Bit propagates the global configuration to each component tracked in that workspace.  
Configure a global tester with the `--tester` flag when importing a compiler component.

```shell
$ bit import bit.envs/testers/mocha --tester
the following component environments were installed
- bit.envs/testers/mocha@0.0.7
```

## Adding test/spec files to your components

We mark components' test files by using the `--tests` option with `bit add`:

```shell
bit add src/foo.js --tests test/foo-test.js
```

For more details about marking files as test files, see [here](/docs/add-and-isolate-components#track-a-component-with-test-spec-files).

## Testing a component

Use [bit test](/docs/apis/cli-all#test) to test components that have an associated tester and test files:

```shell
$ bit test foo/bar
foo/bar
tests passed
file: dist/test/bar.test.js
total duration - 4ms

âœ”   bar should do nothing - 1ms
```

> **Note**
>
> If a component has a [compiler](/docs/building-components.html), Bit will trigger it prior to running the component's tests.
