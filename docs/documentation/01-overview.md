The documentation is presented in the local [Workspace UI](/docs/workspace/workspace-ui), and in the remote [Scope UI](/docs/scope/scope-ui) (e.g, on Bit.dev).

The documentation pages are generated using templates. These templates are determined by the different [environment(s)](/docs/environment/overview) that are set for different types of components. That ensures each component type gets documented in the way that suits its purpose and technology (e.g, a doc template for React UI components and another template for serverless node functions).

In addition to that, Bit exposes a simple API for ad hoc customization.
