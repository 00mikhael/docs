title: External Components

Scope keeps a copy of all external dependencies of your component. This allows your project to remain independent even when keeping many dependencies on components implemented by others.

> **Components, not libraries**

> Bit's external dependencies is limited only for components available on scopes, not for libraries installed from registries.
