The workspace UI displays all workspace' components. It is a development tool that enables you to examine your components in different contexts and variations.

## Features

### Dynamic component list

* The workspace sidebar displays all tracked components in a human-friendly manner. Components are categorized according to their [namespace](#) which represents a category of functions or business concerns.
* The component navigator uses the VSCode language to notify of changes, errors, and other important updates happening to components in the  component tree. For example, the 'E' letter will appear to the right of a component name, in case of an error.

### A single platform for all environments

* Design systems often include more than a single implementation of their UI components. The workspace UI displays all components in a single place, regardless of their framework or environment. Bit does that by using iframes to display components running on different servers, for different environments.
