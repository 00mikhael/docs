## Component Teamwork

*Share components between different projects.*

A team can work together on a componentâ€™s shared code even when projects are located in separate repositories. When a component is updated, or any of its dependencies, a new version is created only for the impacted components.  

Bit manages each component separately. The component's consumer the receive only the changes that are relevant to their projects.  

Bit components sharing accelerate teams' work to build applications with hundreds and thousands of components.

## Isolated Component Environment

*Detach the component from the rest of the project.*

In Bit, each component is created by analyzing all the files and dependencies that build it. each component is becoming a stand-alone entity that can be shared and used across multiple projects.  

Bit provides tools for **building**, **testing**, and **rendering** each component in its own canned environment, so it is clear what's the component is built upon.  

Bit verifies that components are loosely coupled from the rest of the project and help teams to write better code.  

## Component Discovery

*Find the right components for the project.*

Generic search tools (read: Google) can help in locating components only to a certain level. Finding the right component for the project usually requires drilling into the components behind what a search engine can provide.  

Bit provides a Components Hub with dedicated searching and filtering capabilities that can narrow the components search to list only the components that are adequate to your project, by **language**, **framework**, **dependencies**, and **size**.  

Inside the Components Hub, you can see a live version of the component, play with it and create multiple variants of its usage.  

With Bit, components selection is faster.
