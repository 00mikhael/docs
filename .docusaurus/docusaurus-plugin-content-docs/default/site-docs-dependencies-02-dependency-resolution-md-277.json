  "description": "The 'dependency-resolver' parses all import/require statements in a component's code. It then determines, for each required module, whether it is external (i.e, a library/imported component) or a module used internally, as part of the component's implementation files. If a module turns out to be external, it checks its version and adds it to the component dependency graph.",
