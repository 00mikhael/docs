  "description": "Use the Node environment extension API to create your own customized environment extension. The extension component can then be exported to a remote scope to make it available for reuse by other workspaces. Doing so is not only a way to save time (otherwise lost on setting up a dev environment) but also a way to maintain a consistent development environment for independent Node components authored in various decoupled workspaces.",
