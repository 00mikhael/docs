We are constantly expanding our support for different frameworks. After adding Angular support back in August, Vue was the naturally next framework that demanded our attention.  

In fact, we already had a  [Vue compiler](https://bit.dev/bit/envs/bundlers/vue) that was even used by some of Bit users. However, it really required some work. This included updating dependencies to latest versions and verifying that it works with multiple projects.  

The configuration used by the compiler can be found [here](https://bit.dev/bit/envs/bundlers/vue/~code#webpack.config.ts). If you need to make any changes, you should follow the guidelines on how to [fork and change the compiler](/docs/best-practices#changing-compiler-configuration).

To show examples on bit.dev we have added support for Vue projects using the Vue button in the example switcher. By default, the vue-cli v3 generates a project with default configuration. The template generated includes already the import of your components, and add it to the `<script>` section.  

We have also revised the [guidelines](/docs/guidelines-vue) on how to work with Bit and Vue compiler.

Specifically, there is a caveat when importing components in target projects. If you want to rebuild them, you need to [import the SFC directly](/docs/vue-guidelines#using-vue-sfc-in-target-projects).  

Also, when importing components, Bit is using symlinks. To build with Vue CLI symlinks need to be explicitly enabled, as described [here](/docs/vue-guidelines#use-symlinks-false-in-target-project).
