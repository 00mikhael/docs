![Dependencies graph](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/blog/graph%20example.png)

We have introduced a new exciting feature of `bit graph`.  

You can new get a visual display of the dependency graph for specific component or for the entire project.  

<!--truncate-->

This feature is useful to see all your dependencies and their exact versions, and also let you find circular and other dependency issues easily.  

Read the command specifics [here](/docs/apis/cli-all#graph).

This feature complements the ability to show recursively all dependents and dependencies of a specific component in the [`bit show`](/docs/apis/cli-all#show) command.
